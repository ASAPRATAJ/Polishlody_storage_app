PolishLodyStorageApp
Its a simple storage-like application. It was developed because i wanted to learn some practicy with developing app with real use case. It will help me to reduce wasting time on putting things into excel. Instead of excel im using sqlite3 cuz its only for me, but in further implementations i want to use something else to storage data.

To be able to run the app u need to instal kivy package in your python (ver. 3.9 max)
https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html#install-pip

Then u need to instal kivyMD package, because kivyMD widgets are much more eye-friendly
- All you need to do is simply put it in your command line: pip install kivymd

ver.0.01 features:
- add product_name
- add product_value depending on product_name
- subtract product_value depending on product_name
- show_records
- delete product_name in case if you would type something wrong
